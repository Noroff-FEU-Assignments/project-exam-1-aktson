## Description 
This is submission for second semester. Project exam 1 where we have been tasked with creating a blog site with following pages:
-	Home page
-	About page
-	List of blog posts
-	Blog post specific pages
-	Contact page.
JavaScript is used for validation which shows error messages if the values in the textboxes do not meet the requirements.

### WordPress

The content for website is stored on a WordPress installation used as a Headless CMS. WordPress is used only to provide  Rest-API and add content for the blog. Front-end is built using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript and making a call to the WordPress REST API to fetch the data. 

The project has two aspects:
-	API from your WordPress installation
-	Your website built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript


This is my submission for third semester exam submission. An complete CRUD(create/Read/Update/Delete) e-commerce website that has both customer-facing and admin sections where admin can do all the CRUD operations. Both sections are responsive and the website is populated by a Strapi API hosted on Railway.
